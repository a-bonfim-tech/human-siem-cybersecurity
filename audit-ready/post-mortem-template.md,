# AUDIT READY — Post-Mortem Template

## Purpose

This document defines the post-mortem process used within the Human SIEM
operating model.

Post-mortems exist to extract learning,
not to assign blame.

They convert incidents into institutional memory.

---

## When a Post-Mortem Is Required

A post-mortem is conducted when:

* an incident is confirmed
* escalation to leadership occurred
* controls failed or were bypassed
* assumptions proved incorrect
* institutional risk was present

Severity does not determine necessity.
Impact and learning value do.

---

## Post-Mortem Principles

All post-mortems must be:

* factual
* neutral in tone
* focused on decisions and systems
* oriented toward improvement

Blame reduces learning.
Silence preserves risk.

---

## Structure of the Post-Mortem

### 1. Incident Summary

A concise description including:

* what happened
* when it happened
* how it was detected
* current status

No speculation.
Only verified facts.

---

### 2. Timeline of Key Decisions

List significant decisions in order:

* detection
* triage
* escalation
* containment
* resolution

Focus on decisions, not events.

---

### 3. What Worked

Identify:

* controls that functioned correctly
* decisions that reduced impact
* processes that supported response

Successes must be documented
to avoid accidental regression.

---

### 4. What Failed

Identify:

* control gaps
* flawed assumptions
* delayed or missed decisions
* process weaknesses

Failures are described without attribution.

---

### 5. Root Cause Analysis

Root causes focus on:

* system design
* governance gaps
* visibility limitations
* decision logic

Human error is a symptom,
not a root cause.

---

### 6. Risk Reassessment

Evaluate:

* whether risk posture assumptions held
* if tolerance levels remain valid
* if escalation thresholds require adjustment

Risk posture may change post-incident.

---

### 7. Action Items

Define concrete actions:

* what will change
* who owns it
* expected outcome
* review date

Actions must be realistic and measurable.

---

### 8. Lessons Learned

Summarize:

* what the organization knows now
* what will be done differently
* what should never happen again

Lessons must be transferable.

---

## Post-Mortem Review and Closure

Post-mortems are reviewed by:

* security leadership
* relevant stakeholders

Closure occurs when:

* actions are assigned
* learning is documented
* follow-up is scheduled

Unclosed post-mortems represent residual risk.

---

## Final Statement

Incidents are inevitable.
Repeated mistakes are not.

This template exists to ensure that every incident
strengthens the organization instead of weakening it.
