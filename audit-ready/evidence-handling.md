# AUDIT READY — Evidence Handling

## Purpose

This document defines how security evidence is handled within the Human SIEM
operating model.

Evidence handling exists to preserve trust, integrity, and accountability
across technical, legal, and audit contexts.

---

## Evidence Is Not Raw Data

Raw data becomes evidence only when:

* it is relevant to a decision
* its integrity is preserved
* its context is understood
* its handling is documented

Collecting data without purpose does not create evidence.

---

## Principles of Evidence Handling

All evidence must be:

* relevant
* minimal
* protected
* traceable
* handled consistently

Excessive evidence increases risk.
Insufficient evidence weakens accountability.

---

## Types of Evidence

Evidence may include:

* summarized event data
* correlated behavioral patterns
* configuration states
* decision logs
* approved workflow documentation

Screenshots and raw logs are supporting material,
not primary evidence.

---

## Evidence Collection

Evidence is collected only when:

* a security decision requires justification
* escalation or action occurs
* audit or review is anticipated

Evidence collection must not disrupt operations
unless risk requires it.

---

## Evidence Integrity

Evidence integrity requires:

* protection against modification
* clear ownership
* time-bound retention
* access control

If evidence integrity cannot be guaranteed,
its evidentiary value is reduced.

---

## Chain of Custody

When evidence may have legal or regulatory implications,
a chain of custody is established.

The chain of custody records:

* who collected the evidence
* when it was collected
* how it was stored
* who accessed it

Breaks in custody must be documented.

---

## Evidence and Privacy

Evidence handling respects:

* data minimization principles
* privacy obligations
* regulatory requirements

Only evidence necessary for the decision
is retained.

---

## Evidence Review and Disposal

Evidence is reviewed periodically to:

* confirm continued relevance
* reassess retention needs
* safely dispose of obsolete material

Retention without purpose is liability.

---

## Audit Notes

For evidence handling, the following must be explainable:

* why evidence was collected
* how integrity was preserved
* who accessed it
* when it was disposed

Evidence handling must withstand external scrutiny.

---

## Final Statement

Evidence does not protect organizations.
Handled evidence does.

This model exists to ensure that security evidence
supports truth, not confusion.
