# Recruiter & Hiring Manager Reading Paths

This document provides fast, role-appropriate entry points into the Human SIEM repository
for non-technical or semi-technical reviewers.

The goal is **signal, not depth**.

---

## What this repository demonstrates

This is not a production system.

It is a **portfolio of security reasoning**, showing how a senior security professional:

* defines risk posture
* makes defensible decisions
* documents accountability
* aligns security with business and governance

---

## 5-Minute Snapshot (Recommended)

Read **SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md**

You will understand:

* what kind of security system this is
* what problems it is designed to solve
* what level of seniority it represents

---

## 10–15 Minute Structured Review

1. **SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md**
   High-level overview and intent

2. **ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md**
   Why specific security choices were made

3. **README.md**
   Repository structure and evaluation path

---

## What to look for

* Clear decision rationale
* Explicit trade-offs
* Governance awareness
* Ability to explain decisions months later
* Comfort saying “no”, “yes”, or “not now”

---

## What not to expect

* No vendor tooling
* No configuration files
* No detections or rules
* No operational metrics

This repository evaluates **judgment**, not implementation speed.

---

## How to use this in hiring

This repository is strong evidence for roles such as:

* Security Architect
* Detection Engineering Lead
* Head of Security
* Cloud Security Lead
* Governance & Risk-focused Security Roles

If a candidate can author and defend work like this,
they can operate effectively at senior or principal levels.

---

## Final Note

This repository exists to answer one question:

**“Can this person be trusted to make irreversible security decisions?”**

Everything here is designed to make that answer visible.
