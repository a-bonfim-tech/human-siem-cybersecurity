# Sponsorship & Public Value

This repository is supported through GitHub Sponsors to ensure the **continuous public development of security decision frameworks**.

## What sponsorship supports

Sponsorship funds time and focus for:

* Designing cloud security and governance frameworks (GCP-first, multi-cloud aware)
* Publishing audit-ready runbooks and decision models
* Documenting senior-level security reasoning in a compliance-safe way
* Maintaining repositories as long-lived reference material

## What sponsors do NOT receive

* No private consulting
* No privileged access
* No proprietary artifacts
* No influence over conclusions

This work remains:

* Public
* Vendor-neutral
* Abstracted and non-operational
* Safe for audits and professional review

## Why this matters

Most security content teaches *tools*.
This work documents **judgment**.

The goal is to reduce noise, prevent alert fatigue, and model how defensible decisions are made under uncertainty.

If your organization values **clarity, restraint, and accountability in security**, sponsorship helps keep this work sustainable.
