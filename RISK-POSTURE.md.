# RISK POSTURE — Human SIEM Cybersecurity Operating System

## Purpose

This document defines the risk posture adopted by the Human SIEM operating model.

Its goal is to make explicit:

* which risks are tolerated
* which risks are unacceptable
* when security decisions require executive involvement

Unclear risk posture creates inconsistent decisions.
Explicit posture creates trust.

---

## Risk Is a Management Decision

Risk is not a technical anomaly.
Risk is a management choice.

Cybersecurity does not eliminate risk.
It clarifies risk so that informed decisions can be made at the appropriate level.

This operating model exists to support those decisions.

---

## Risk Categories

### 1. Acceptable Risk

Risk may be accepted when:

* impact is low or reversible
* compensating controls exist
* exposure is time-bound
* the decision is documented

Acceptance does not mean ignorance.
Acceptance means awareness with intent.

---

### 2. Monitored Risk

Risk is monitored when:

* behavior is unusual but understood
* confidence of malicious intent is low
* additional context is required over time

Monitored risk requires visibility without escalation.
It is neither ignored nor alarmed.

---

### 3. Unacceptable Risk

Risk is unacceptable when:

* privileged access is abused
* irreversible damage is possible
* legal or regulatory exposure exists
* trust boundaries are crossed

Unacceptable risk requires immediate action or escalation.

---

## Technical Risk vs Institutional Risk

### Technical Risk

* localized
* reversible
* contained within systems

Handled by security and engineering teams.

### Institutional Risk

* legal exposure
* reputational damage
* business continuity impact
* accountability beyond technical teams

Requires leadership awareness and decision.

Security escalates when risk becomes institutional.

---

## Escalation Criteria

Escalation to leadership occurs when:

* risk exceeds documented tolerance
* security actions affect business availability
* decision accountability moves beyond the security function
* ambiguity cannot be resolved with technical evidence alone

Escalation is not failure.
Failure is silent institutional risk.

---

## Time as a Risk Factor

Risk increases with time.

This model assumes:

* unresolved ambiguity is risk
* delayed decisions amplify impact
* prolonged silence requires reassessment

Time-bound reviews are mandatory for accepted and monitored risk.

---

## Risk Documentation

All risk-related decisions must include:

* description of the risk
* decision taken
* rationale
* owner
* review date

Documentation converts risk into governance.

---

## Relationship with Compliance

Compliance requirements are treated as:

* minimum constraints, not maximum goals
* non-negotiable when legally binding

Security posture aligns with compliance
but is not limited by it.

---

## Final Statement

Security maturity is demonstrated by the ability
to say “yes”, “no”, and “not now” with clarity.

This risk posture exists to make those answers consistent,
defensible, and aligned with organizational reality.
