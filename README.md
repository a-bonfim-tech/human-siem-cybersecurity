# Human SIEM — Cybersecurity Operating System

This repository documents a governance-driven cybersecurity operating system
designed to model how a senior security professional thinks, decides, and
documents risk.

It is not a collection of tools.
It is a collection of judgment.

> **IIf you only read one thing:

👉 examples/decision-end-to-end.md — a complete, end-to-end example of how security decisions are reasoned, validated, governed, and made audit-ready.

👉 SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md — a one-page overview of the architecture, design principles, and intent behind this system.


## Use This Repository as a Template

This repository is designed to be **forked as a template**, not studied as a static document.

It provides a **replicable, audit-ready framework** for modeling how security decisions are made, validated, and defended under scrutiny.

### Intended Use

* Clone via **“Use this template”**
* Adapt scope (cloud, on-prem, hybrid)
* Produce **defensible decision evidence**, not detections

### 15-Minute Evaluation Path (for reviewers)

1. Read START_HERE.md
2. Read SECURITY-ARCHITECTURE-SNAPSHOT.md
3. Review ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md
4. Read the end-to-end example:
   examples/decision-end-to-end.md
5. Review one decision in audit-mapping/
6. Inspect validation logic in validation/
7. Check governance constraints in GOVERNANCE.md

This is not a toolset.
It is a **governance operating model**.

## Purpose

To demonstrate how cybersecurity excellence is achieved through:
- signal selection over data accumulation
- correlation over isolated alerts
- silence by design over alert fatigue
- audit-ready decision making

## What this repository is

- A public, compliant portfolio of cybersecurity reasoning
- A transferable operating model aligned with SOC, Audit, and Leadership
- A documentation-first approach to trust and governance

## What this repository is NOT

- No real logs
- No real infrastructure
- No copy-paste detection rules
- No organizational secrets

All examples are abstracted, synthetic, and compliance-safe.

## Core Principles

- Identity is the primary control plane
- Every alert must be defensible six months later
- Silence is a security decision
- Automation amplifies thinking — it does not replace it

## Structure

- runbooks/: enterprise-style operational logic
- detection-strategy/: hypothesis and correlation models
- soc-alignment/: triage and escalation reasoning
- audit-ready/: documentation templates for compliance

## Intended Audience

- Security leadership (CISO, Head of Security)
- SOC and Detection Engineering
- Risk, Audit, and Compliance stakeholders
