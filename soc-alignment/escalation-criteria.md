# SOC ALIGNMENT — Escalation Criteria

## Purpose

This document defines when and how security decisions
are escalated within the Human SIEM operating model.

Escalation exists to ensure that accountability
moves to the correct level at the correct time.

---

## Escalation Is Not Failure

Escalation does not indicate loss of control.
Escalation indicates recognition of impact boundaries.

Failure occurs when institutional risk
is handled silently at the technical level.

---

## Triggers for Escalation

Escalation is required when any of the following conditions exist:

* potential for irreversible damage
* involvement of privileged or systemic access
* legal, regulatory, or contractual exposure
* impact on business continuity
* reputational or trust implications
* ambiguity that cannot be resolved with technical evidence

Any single condition is sufficient.

---

## Levels of Escalation

### Operational Escalation

Used when:

* additional technical expertise is required
* containment actions may affect availability
* coordinated response is needed

Ownership remains within technical teams.

---

### Managerial Escalation

Used when:

* security decisions affect team priorities
* resource allocation is required
* risk acceptance may be necessary

Ownership shifts to management.

---

### Executive Escalation

Used when:

* institutional risk is present
* external communication may be required
* regulatory obligations are triggered
* accountability extends beyond IT

Ownership shifts to leadership.

---

## Escalation Content Requirements

Every escalation must include:

* concise summary of the situation
* what is known and unknown
* potential impact scenarios
* actions already taken
* decisions required

Escalation without clarity increases risk.

---

## Timing of Escalation

Escalation must be:

* early enough to preserve options
* late enough to avoid noise

Delayed escalation amplifies damage.
Premature escalation erodes trust.

---

## Escalation and Documentation

All escalations must be documented with:

* trigger conditions
* decision owners
* outcomes
* follow-up actions

Documentation protects both the organization
and the decision-makers.

---

## De-escalation

Escalation ends when:

* risk is reduced below tolerance
* decisions are made at the appropriate level
* responsibility is reassigned

De-escalation must be communicated clearly.

---

## Final Statement

Escalation is how organizations
exercise collective responsibility.

This model exists to ensure that security decisions
reach the right people before consequences do.
