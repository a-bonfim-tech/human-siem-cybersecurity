# Contributing Guidelines

This repository is a **template**, not a collaborative open-source project.

Contributions here are about **adapting the framework**, not expanding scope.

## How to Use This Template

When creating a repository from this template:

* Rename the repository to reflect your environment
* Adjust scope explicitly (cloud, on-prem, hybrid)
* Preserve structure unless you can justify deviation

## What Is a Valid Contribution

A valid contribution:

* Improves clarity of decision reasoning
* Strengthens auditability
* Tightens governance or escalation logic
* Preserves ethics and compliance constraints

A contribution must always answer:

> “Does this make decisions easier to explain, validate, and defend later?”

## What Is Not a Valid Contribution

* Adding tools without governance context
* Copy-paste detection rules
* Environment-specific secrets or configurations
* Expanding scope without explicit risk posture update

## Review Philosophy

Every change is reviewed as a **decision**, not as code.

If a change cannot be defended in an audit or leadership review,
it does not belong here.
