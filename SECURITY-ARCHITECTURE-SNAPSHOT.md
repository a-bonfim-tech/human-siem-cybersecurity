# Security Architecture Snapshot

## What is this?

This repository represents a **Human-Centered SIEM and Security Governance Architecture**.

It models **how security decisions are made**, not just how alerts are generated.

---

## Why it exists

Most security portfolios show **tools**.
This one shows **thinking**.

The objective is to demonstrate the ability to:

* reason about risk
* define escalation boundaries
* document decisions for audit and leadership
* balance security, business, and compliance constraints

---

## What problem it solves

Organizations fail audits and incident response not because of missing tools, but because:

* decisions are undocumented
* rationale is lost over time
* escalation criteria are implicit
* accountability is unclear

This architecture exists to make decisions:

* explicit
* reviewable
* defensible months later

---

## What kind of professional builds this?

Someone who:

* understands that **risk is a management decision**
* designs security for **audit and leadership visibility**
* values **silence by design** over alert volume
* treats documentation as a security control

---

## What this is NOT

* Not a SOC tool
* Not a SIEM product
* Not production infrastructure

All content is synthetic, abstracted, and compliance-safe.

---

## How to evaluate this repository (5 minutes)

1. Read **START_HERE.md**
2. Skim **ARCHITECTURE-DECISIONS.md**
3. Look at one file in **audit-mapping/**
4. Observe how decisions are justified, not just stated

If the reasoning is clear, the system works.

---

## Summary (for non-technical readers)

This repository demonstrates **how mature cybersecurity organizations think**.

It is evidence of **judgment, structure, and accountability** — not tooling.
