# Ethics as a Control Plane

This framework treats ethics as a **hard security control**, not a cultural aspiration.

Ethics here define **what actions are allowed to exist** inside the system.

## Non-Negotiable Constraints

1. **No decision without evidence**
   Any decision lacking explicit evidence is invalid.

2. **No silent authority**
   Authority must be documented, scoped, and reviewable.

3. **No real organizational data**
   All examples are synthetic, abstracted, and compliance-safe.

4. **Silence is a decision**
   Non-action must be documented with rationale and risk posture.

5. **Validation precedes escalation**
   Escalation without a stated hypothesis is a failure.

6. **Ethics override urgency**
   Speed never justifies undocumented or unjustified action.

7. **Reproducibility over intuition**
   If the reasoning cannot be replayed, it cannot be trusted.

## Enforcement Model

Violating these constraints is treated as a **system integrity failure**, not a personal error.

This framework assumes:

* Review
* Audit
* Adversarial questioning

Ethics are enforced by **structure**, not belief.
